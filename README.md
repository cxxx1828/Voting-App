DecideIT is a multi-module Android application developed in Java using Android Studio, a JetBrains IDE. The goal of the project was to build a complete voting system that allows students to participate in voting sessions while administrators manage user accounts and session creation. The project was implemented through several incremental development phases. The first phase focused on the UI structure of the application, where I created multiple activities and fragments, including login and registration screens, a calendar view for selecting sessions, a voting screen, and an admin interface. Navigation between screens was implemented using intents and fragment transactions, and all layouts were created using LinearLayout and FrameLayout without margins, following strict UI constraints.

In the next phase, the focus was on dynamic content and custom UI components. I implemented custom adapters for displaying lists of students and voting sessions, where each item contained images, text, and interactive controls. User actions triggered UI updates, such as confirmation dialogs when deleting a student from a list. The third phase introduced persistent storage using SQLite. I replaced previously hard-coded data with a fully structured database containing user accounts, session information, and anonymous voting results. Passwords were stored as hashed values for security, and the Factory design pattern was implemented to abstract database operations and improve scalability.

The fourth phase extended the application with full HTTP server communication. I ran a local backend written in Node.js with Express and MongoDB. From the Android app, I implemented an HTTP client capable of sending GET and POST requests to the server. All session data and voting results were retrieved by sending REST API requests, parsing JSON responses, and synchronizing them with the existing local SQLite database. When new sessions or votes were created on the device, the app immediately sent the data to the server, ensuring that the server and the local database remained consistent.

The final phase introduced background processing. I implemented a bound Android Service that periodically checks whether a voting session is close to expiring. If a session is ending within fifteen minutes, the service triggers a push notification. Tapping the notification takes the user directly to the voting screen, making the app responsive and user-friendly even when running in the background.

Overall, DecideIT represents a complete end-to-end Android solution that combines UI development, fragment-based navigation, SQLite persistence, REST API communication with a Node.js and MongoDB server, custom adapters, background services, and push notifications. The entire application was built in JetBrains’ Android Studio, and throughout the process I relied heavily on JetBrains tooling for code navigation, refactoring, debugging, and project organization.
